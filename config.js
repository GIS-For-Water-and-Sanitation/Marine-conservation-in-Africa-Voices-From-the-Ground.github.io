Inevitably this would not have been a success without the active participation of other members (both WSPs and other) who attended the workshop. Special appreciation is also extended to the program’s implementing partners who provided technical and financial resources to develop the program that is currently anchored in the WASPA Strategic Plan 2013 – 2017. The European Union, Vitens Evides International, SNV Kenya, KEWI, GIZ as well as WASREB have been very close to the heart of the program. It is our hope that this product/service will be facilitated to benefit all the WSPs now and in the future. ',

Inevitably this would not have been a success without the active participation of other members (both WSPs and other) who attended the workshop. Special appreciation is also extended to the program’s implementing partners who provided technical and financial resources to develop the program that is currently anchored in the WASPA Strategic Plan 2013 – 2017. The European Union, Vitens Evides International, SNV Kenya, KEWI, GIZ as well as WASREB have been very close to the heart of the program. It is our hope that this product/service will be facilitated to benefit all the WSPs now and in the future. ',
